## How To Use :

To use the **Twilight.dll** mod, you will need a DLL injector.  
I recommend using [ProcessHacker](https://sourceforge.net/projects/processhacker/).

1. Download the latest version of [Twilight.dll](https://github.com/Mistakeyy/Twilight/releases)
2. Start **RISK: Global Domination**.
3. Open **ProcessHacker**.
4. In ProcessHacker, search for **Risk.exe**.
5. Right-click **Risk.exe**, then choose:  
   **Miscellaneous → Inject DLL**
6. Select **Twilight.dll**.
7. ## Press HOME to open the menu

## Note :

Using these features repeatedly or too quickly:
Skip To Player / Next Phase / Skip Turn / Eliminate / Revive
may cause a crash, and they currently have some issues.

Skip To Player has a built-in 400ms delay to reduce crash probability.

I will try to fix these issues and add more features soon.

## ⚠️ Important Warning

 This tool is NOT safe and can result in:

Account ban, and

HWID ban

 It is strongly recommended to use it on a secondary account
 and always use it with a spoofer.
