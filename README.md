## Twilight Risk Global Domination Cheat

### Feature List
## Match :

Edit Card
Add Troops

## Map Editor :

Territory list + search

Give territory to any player

Change territory troop count

## Feature :

Instant Win

Instant win, but it has some issues right now — not recommended to use at the moment.

Skip Turn

For example: if the turn is on the green player, it skips to the next player.

Next Phase

For example: if the game is in Attack, it skips directly to Fortify.

Skip To Player

Choose the player you want the turn to jump to.

Eliminate

Eliminate any player — they can no longer play, but their territories stay on the map.

Revive

Revive a player back to the game.
If the player has no territories, you can give them one from the Map Editor.

## Unlock All :

Unlocks all items.

## How To Use :

To use the **Twilight.dll** mod, you will need a DLL injector.  
I recommend using [ProcessHacker](https://sourceforge.net/projects/processhacker/).

1. Download the latest version of [Twilight.dll](https://github.com/Mistakeyy/Twilight/releases)
2. Start **RISK: Global Domination**.
3. Open **ProcessHacker**.
4. In ProcessHacker, search for **Risk.exe**.
5. Right-click **Risk.exe**, then choose:  
   **Miscellaneous → Inject DLL**
6. Select **Twilight.dll**.

## Note :

Using these features repeatedly or too quickly:
Skip To Player / Next Phase / Skip Turn / Eliminate / Revive
may cause a crash, and they currently have some issues.

Skip To Player has a built-in 400ms delay to reduce crash probability.

I will try to fix these issues and add more features soon.

## ⚠️ Important Warning

 This tool is NOT safe and can result in:

Account ban, and

HWID ban

 It is strongly recommended to use it on a secondary account
 and always use it with a spoofer.
